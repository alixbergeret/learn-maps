### What is Learn Maps?
This "serverless" project is a fun geography learning tool that showcase what can be achieved with Google APIs:
- [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview): to display the interactive map with custom styling (i.e. no visible country names).
- [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview): to get a "Google place" from the coordinates the user clicked on, and check if it's correct.
- [Places API (New)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview): to get the central coordinates of a given "Google place", to display a marker if correct guess.
- [Google Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup): to store the list of maps and countries/regions for each map.


All code is written in vanilla Javascript.
